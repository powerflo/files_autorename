# AutoRename  

AutoRename is a Nextcloud app that automatically renames and organizes newly added or moved files based on user-defined rules.  

## How It Works  

- Place a `.rename.conf` file in a folder to define renaming and moving rules using regular expressions.  
- When files are uploaded or moved into that folder, they will be renamed or moved according to the rules.  
- A background job runs every few minutes to process the files, so changes may not be immediate. 

## Features  

âœ… Define renaming and moving rules with regular expressions  
âœ… Automatically process newly added or moved files  
âœ… Organize files into subfolders dynamically  
âœ… Use placeholders to insert the current date in filenames  

## Installation  

1. Install [AutoRename via the Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_autorename) or manually place the app in the `apps-extra/` directory.  
2. Enable the app in the Nextcloud admin panel.  
3. Ensure background jobs (cron) are configured for Nextcloud.  

## Configuration  

To use AutoRename, create a `.rename.conf` file in the desired folder. The file should contain rules in the following format:  

`pattern:replacement`

The pattern is a regular expression to match the original file name. You can learn more and test your regex patterns at [regex101.com](https://regex101.com)

### Example Rules

```
# Rename "Entgeltabrechnung_Januar_2022 aybabtu.pdf" to "2022-01_Entgeltabrechnung aybabtu.pdf":
^(Entgeltabrechnung_Januar)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-01_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_Februar)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-02_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_MÃ¤rz)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-03_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_April)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-04_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_Mai)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-05_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_Juni)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-06_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_Juli)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-07_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_August)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-08_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_September)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-09_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_Oktober)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-10_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_November)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-11_$1$3$4
^(Entgeltabrechnung_Dezember)_(\d{4})(.*)(\.pdf)$:$2-12_$1$3$4

# Move account statements to "KontoauszÃ¼ge/YEAR/FILENAME"
^Kontoauszug.*_(20\d{2})_.*\.pdf$:KontoauszÃ¼ge/$1/$0

# Move securities documents to "Wertpapierdokumente/YEAR/FILENAME"
^Ertragsabrechnung.*\.(20\d{2})_.*\.pdf$:Wertpapierdokumente/$1/$0
^Depotauszug.*\.(20\d{2})_.*\.pdf$:Wertpapierdokumente/$1/$0

# Change date format in filename from tt.mm.yyyy to yyyy-mm-tt
(.*)(\d{2})\.(\d{2})\.(20\d{2})(.*):$1$4-$3-$2$5

# Use the current date in the filename
# Rename "report.pdf" to "report_2025-02-10.pdf" (assuming today's date is 2025-02-10)
^(report)(\.pdf)$:$1_{date}$2

# Use a custom date format in the filename
# Rename "report.pdf" to "report_10-02-2025.pdf" (assuming today's date is 2025-02-10)
^(report)(\.pdf)$:$1_{date|d-m-Y}$2
```

## Notes  

- The first matching rule in `.rename.conf` will be applied. 
- Only newly added or moved files are processed; existing files are not renamed.
- Processing occurs in a background job, so file renaming may take a few minutes.
